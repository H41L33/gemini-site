## Posts & Updates

A link directory to all my posts, available to view as page, download as plaintext or markdown. Each post is a copy of boilerplate HTML like the rest of this website, and has been written directly into HTML.

I have my own scripts to convert my content between HTML, Markdown, and TXT (now powered by Slate ✨).

All the content is loaded immediately, no infinite scrolling, and all my posts are available to view as a page, or download in TXT and MD formats.
